# QuickGo
QuickGo is a keyboard-powered URL launcher that lets you instantly jump to your favorite websites with a simple 'go shortcut' command in your Chrome address bar. Forget fumbling through bookmarks—just type and go!

# How It Works (User Perspective):

- **Jump to a Site**: In Chrome’s address bar, type go followed by a space and your shortcut (e.g., go gmail) and hit Enter. QuickGo looks up the saved URL and sends you there.
- **Manage Your Shortcuts**: Type go go to open the QuickGo options page. Here, you can add new shortcuts, edit or delete existing ones, and even import/export your entire set of links.
- **Backup or Share**: Use the export/import features to easily back up your shortcuts or share them with a friend (if you’re feeling generous).
